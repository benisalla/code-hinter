# code-hinter

Welcome to **code-hinter**, an optional project developed at Ã‰cole Centrale de Lyon. This project consists of a backend written in Python and a frontend using Node.js. Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have Python and Node.js installed on your system. You will also need `pip` for Python packages and `npm` for Node.js packages.

## Setting up the Backend

1. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

   - **For Linux:**
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/Activate
     ```

   - **For Windows: But Using Git Bash**
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source ./venv/Scripts/activate
     ```

2. **Install Required Packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Setting up the Frontend

1. **Install Node.js Packages:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend Application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Running the Project

Once you have set up both the backend and frontend:

- The backend should be running in the environment you've activated.
- The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if specified).

Enjoy exploring **code-hinter**!
